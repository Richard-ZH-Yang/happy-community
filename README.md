# Happy Community

## About This Project
This Project is built to attend the Unihack'21 event.

## Inspiration
During the COVID-19 era, mental health problems become increasingly crucial `[Bueno-Notivol et al., 2021]` `[Yamada 2021]`. Our project aimed to provide an online platform for people to write diaries, share stories, and make friends. 

## What It Does
The users can write journals on our website, and our LSTM machine learning model `[Hochreiter, 1997]` will analyze the score of happiness based the language and tell the users, on a scale of 100, how happy they are in the day. Besides, users are able to view the history of happiness and share their story in the community.


## How We Built It
Our backend was written in `SQL` and `Python`. Our front end was written in `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`

## Challenges We Ran into
All of us are amateurs to web development (especially `Javascript` and data fetching), so we had to learn both the front end and back end *from scratch* and then build a working website. The hardest part is the synchronization between the two parts. 

## Accomplishments that We're Proud of
We are proud that we have completed the essential part of the website, with the back end and front end working together.

## What We Learned
All of us know nothing about `JavaScript` and `SQL` before we attended this Unihack'21 event. During the hackathon, we taught everything by ourselves and learned a lot about the front end and back end as well as how to connect front end and back end.

## What's Next for Happy Community
We are planing to continue building our project even though the event is over. We plan to add new features such as viewing journal histories and posting stories in the community. We want to plan to add visualizations to demonstrate the score to help one track their happiness score over time.
